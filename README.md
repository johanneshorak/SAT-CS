# Simplified Automobile Thermodynamics in C#
SAT-CS is a model that calculates the time course of the cabin air temperature within a vehicle in dependence of three atmospheric parameters available at standard weather stations (air temperature at 2m, global radiation and wind speed). The model and underlying physics, as well as its evaluation with field experiments, were described in [Horak et al 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-016-1861-3).

**note:**

(i) This model was implemented in C#. I've been working on a python3 implementation, however, I have not had the time to finish it (https://github.com/johanneshorak/SAT)
(ii) The model UI is in german (I'm working on an english translation currently)
(iii) The code is a mixture of English and German and would require translating (in some parts) as well.
(iv) There's no documentation currently on how to run the model. I'll try to write up a quick start section with sample files.
